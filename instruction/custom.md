## What if my TF/motif of interest is not included in the default annotation?
  
Currently, `TRIPOD` can be used with two comprehensive TF binding
motif databases,
[JASPAR](https://jaspar.genereg.net/)
and [HOCOMOCO](https://hocomoco11.autosome.ru/downloads_v11).

If your TF/motif of interest is not included in the databases,
you can manually create a position frequency matrix (PFM) and add it to
the motif data. You can also replace the existing motif information
for a given TF with a custom PFM.
See section 3.6 in [the preprocessing vignettes for the mouse embryonic
brain data](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yharigaya/TRIPOD/blob/main/vignettes/preprocessing_e18.html).
